# 👋 Hi, I’m Komail Altaf

I’m a **Backend Engineer (Python & Automation)** with **6+ years of professional experience**, building and maintaining production systems across web, backend, and data-heavy environments.

I work primarily with **Python** to design APIs, data pipelines, and automation workflows that are reliable, scalable, and easy to maintain. My background in backend-focused web development allows me to bridge product needs with solid engineering — turning real business problems into working systems.

I’m especially comfortable working under production pressure: reading existing codebases, refactoring legacy systems, improving performance, and shipping features that actually get used.
