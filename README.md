👋 Hey, I'm Komail Altaf

I’m a Data Scientist with over 6 years of experience in web development, backend systems, and automation. I specialize in turning complex data into simple, actionable insights and building systems that are fast, reliable, and scalable.

My background in full-stack development helps me connect data science with real engineering — automating workflows, improving performance, and creating solutions that actually make a difference. I enjoy solving technical problems, optimizing processes, and learning new ways to make data work smarter.
