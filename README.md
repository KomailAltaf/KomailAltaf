# 👋 Hey, I'm Komail Altaf

I'm a Web Developer with over 5+ years of experience delivering secure, high-performance websites and backend systems. I'm currently studying Data Science at NOVA IMS to deepen my knowledge in data processing, automation, and scalable infrastructure. My core focus is on building reliable, fast, and maintainable backend systems, integrating third-party services, and optimizing applications for performance.

I'm passionate about engineering solutions that work at scale — from automating workflows to monitoring system performance, and I enjoy working in fast-paced environments that challenge me to grow.
